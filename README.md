# Fine-Tuning YOLOv8 for Vehicle Detection

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to train and fine-tune a YOLOv8 model on a custom vehicle detection dataset using **Ultralytics YOLOv8** and **Roboflow**.

## Overview

This project walks through the following steps:

1. **Install and set up YOLOv8** from Ultralytics.  
2. **Download a custom vehicle dataset** from Roboflow.  
3. **Load a pretrained YOLOv8 model** (`yolov8n.pt`).  
4. **Fine-tune the model** on the vehicle dataset.  
5. **Visualize training insights and performance metrics.**  
6. **Download the best-trained weights** for inference or deployment.

## Goal

By the end of this notebook, you will have a **custom-trained YOLOv8 model** capable of detecting various types of vehicles with high accuracy.

## Results and Insights

The following image shows the training performance metrics (loss curves, precision, recall, and mAP scores) generated during fine-tuning:

## Requirements

- Google Colab environment  
- Roboflow account (for dataset access)  
- Basic understanding of Python and computer vision

## How to Use

1. Open the Colab notebook `Train_YOLOv8_for_Vehicle_Detection.ipynb` in Google Colab.  
2. Run all cells sequentially to install dependencies, download the dataset, and train the model.  
3. The trained weights will be available in:  
   ```
   /content/runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt
   ```
4. You can download the weights using the provided code snippet in the notebook.
